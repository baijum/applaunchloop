# Play Store Upload

Upload the release AAB to Google Play Store's internal testing track using the Gradle Play Publisher (GPP) plugin.

## Prerequisites

These must be completed once before first use:

### 1. Google Cloud Service Account

1. Create or select a GCP project at https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable the [AndroidPublisher API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/androidpublisher.googleapis.com)
3. Create a [service account and JSON key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey):
   - Select "New service account"
   - Name it (e.g., `play-publisher`)
   - Give it the "Project Owner" role temporarily
   - Create a JSON key and download it
4. Place the JSON key file at `app/play-service-account.json` (already in `.gitignore`)
5. Remove the "Project Owner" role from the service account in [IAM settings](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)

### 2. Play Console Permissions

1. Go to [Users and permissions](https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions)
2. Click "Invite new user"
3. Paste the service account email (found in the JSON key file)
4. Grant permissions: "Release to testing tracks" and "Manage store presence"
5. Restrict to the app `com.baijum.applaunchloop`

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
./gradlew bootstrapListing
```

If this succeeds, the service account is correctly connected.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify the release AAB exists

The AAB should already be built by the [android-release](.cursor/skills/android-release/SKILL.md) skill. Verify it exists:

```bash
ls -lh app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

If it doesn't exist, build it:

```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

### Step 2: Upload to internal testing

```bash
./gradlew publishReleaseBundle
```

- Use `block_until_ms: 120000` (upload can take 30-60s depending on file size and network).
- This uploads the AAB to the **internal testing** track.
- The release is created with status `COMPLETED` (immediately available to internal testers).

### Step 3: Report result

After a successful upload, provide:
- Confirmation that the AAB was uploaded to internal testing
- Link: https://play.google.com/console/developers/apps/com.baijum.applaunchloop/tracks/internal-testing

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Upload to internal | `./gradlew publishReleaseBundle` |
| Promote to production | `./gradlew promoteReleaseArtifact --track production --release-status completed` |
| Promote to beta | `./gradlew promoteReleaseArtifact --track beta` |
| Staged rollout (10%) | `./gradlew promoteReleaseArtifact --track production --release-status inProgress --user-fraction 0.1` |
| Validate setup | `./gradlew bootstrapListing` |
| List GPP tasks | `./gradlew tasks --group publishing` |

## Troubleshooting

- **"No service account credentials"**: Ensure `app/play-service-account.json` exists. Alternatively, set the `ANDROID_PUBLISHER_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the JSON file contents.
- **"Unauthorized" or 403**: The service account email needs permissions in Play Console. Check Users and permissions.
- **"App not found"**: The first version must be uploaded manually via Play Console. The API cannot register new apps.
- **"Version code already exists"**: Bump `versionCode` in `app/build.gradle.kts` before uploading.
- **"APK specifies a version code that has already been used"**: Same as above -- each upload needs a unique, incrementing version code.
- **Build fails with GPP errors**: Run `./gradlew clean bundleRelease` then retry the publish.
