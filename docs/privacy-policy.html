    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>AppLaunchLoop</strong> is a free and open source Android utility built by Baijum. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>AppLaunchLoop is designed to be privacy-first. We do not collect personal data, we do not track you, and we do not serve advertisements. All daily testing operations run entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect names, email addresses, or account information.</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs.</li>
        <li>We do not serve advertisements.</li>
        <li>We do not access your contacts, camera, microphone, or location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>AppLaunchLoop stores the following data locally on your device using Android Jetpack DataStore. This data never leaves your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Active campaign ID</li>
        <li>Target app package name(s)</li>
        <li>Daily testing streak count (0–14)</li>
        <li>Timestamp of last test run</li>
        <li>Your role preference (Creator or Tester)</li>
        <li>Campaign IDs you have created</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can clear all local data at any time by clearing the app's data in Android Settings or by uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored in the Cloud</h2>
    <p>When a Creator creates a testing campaign, the following information is written to Firebase Firestore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A randomly generated campaign ID</li>
        <li>The Google Group email address entered by the Creator</li>
        <li>The target app package name entered by the Creator</li>
        <li>A timestamp of when the campaign was created</li>
        <li>An anonymous device identifier (Android ID) so the Creator can manage or delete the campaign from their device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No user authentication or login is required. No personal information is stored in the cloud.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet &amp; Network State</strong> — To read and write campaign data from Firebase Firestore.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications (Android 13+)</strong> — To send daily testing reminder notifications. You can deny or revoke this permission at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Boot Completed</strong> — To reschedule daily reminder notifications after a device restart.</li>
    </ul>

Firebase may collect limited technical data such as IP addresses for service operation. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
